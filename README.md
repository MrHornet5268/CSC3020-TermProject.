# CSC3020-TermProject
# Time Management App

## Project Overview
The Time Management App helps students and professionals organize their schedules, set goals, and track daily tasks. The goal is to provide an easy to use interface where users can add tasks, set deadlines, and receive reminders, improving productivity and reducing stress.

## Why This Project?
I chose this project because managing time effectively is one of the biggest challenges for students like me. Having an app that helps prioritize tasks and balance responsibilities can make a big difference in academic and personal success.
